# @overwolf/types

Overwolf type definition files for autocompletion and documentation purposes.  

## Install

This is the preferred method. Getting type declarations in TypeScript 2.0 and above requires no tools apart from npm.

```
$ npm i --save-dev @overwolf/types
```

## Usage

To use it in your Typescript project, you should include this line on the top of each file that use the types.

```
import "@overwolf/types";
```
